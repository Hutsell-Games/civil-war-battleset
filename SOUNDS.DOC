1. Capability has been added to allow use of Sound Blaster
   (trademark of Creative Labs, Inc.) sound cards via the
   Creative Labs software utilities and the CTVDSK disk voice
   driver, which are merged into this application. These files
   are included along with the necessary *.VOC sound files,
   compressed in the SOUNDS.Z~P file, which must be uncompressed
   before it can be used. A small batch file SOUNDS.BAT is
   provided to do this.

   !    NOTE: The method used with the sound card reads the sound      !
   !    files from disk as the game is playing. If you not have        !
   !    both a HARD DISK and a DISK CACHE this will appreciably slow   !
   !    the game.                                                      !
   !...................................................................!
   !    If you do not have a DISK CACHE you CAN run the program with   !
   !    sounds from a RAM DRIVE. Be sure the sounds are all on the     !
   !    RAM DRIVE, and the GO.BAT file, all *.EGA files, and the       !
   !    *.CFG files as a minimum. Be sure the GO.BAT file has the      !
   !    proper path for the CW.EXE program. (A DISK CACHE is the       !
   !    easier way !                                                   !
   !                                                                   !

   You must take the following steps to prepare for this sound
   card support:

   a.  Uncompress the necessary files by typing:

       SOUNDS

       The uncompressed files will require about 180K - be sure
       there is enough room on the disk. If you are on a hard
       drive, you may delete the SOUNDS.ZIP file after you
       extract the files in order to free up disk space.

   The program should then be ready to use Sound Blaster or
   equivalent cards. It has been tested on different Sound
   Blaster systems, and is also known to work with the Advanced
   Gravis Ultrasound card. However, since this relies on specific
   Creative Labs software utilities, it may or may not work on
   other systems. There are no guarantees the sound will work
   with any particular user arrangement.

   |             TO RUN PROGRAM WITH SOUND BLASTER                   |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
   |  Type GO /S and the sound driver will load, and the program     |
   |  will run. You should hear drumbeats at the title screen. When  |
   |  you finish the game, the sound driver will automatically       |
   |  unload to free system memory                                   |
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------+

    The sound files themselves are provided in a "raw" .VOC format,
    which means they may be customized if you have capability to
    produce/edit .VOC files. (If you have or can make .WAV files,
    there are utilities that will let you change them to .VOC
    format). The files you create should be kept about the same size
    as the ones provide to keep game playable; .VOC files can
    become HUGE if you aren't very careful.
