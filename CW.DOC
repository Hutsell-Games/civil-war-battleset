                     CIVILWAR BATTLE SET 2.4
     ===========================================================
      1 INTRODUCTION
     ===========================================================
      1.1   Description
     ==================
     CIVILWAR BATTLE SET Version 2.4 is an EGA tactical level war game
     based on battles from the American Civil War. It represents over
     four years of research, programming, and play testing. It is an
     evolution of the prize-winning ASCII game which has earned
     accolades from wargamers around the world. The game is easy to
     play, yet difficult to master, and provides an almost endless set
     of variations and challenges.
     
     "Winning" the battles depends on relative casualties, number
     of units eliminated, and controlling a key location on the
     battlefield (the 'objective'). There are several types of
     units and varying terrain situations, all of which affect
     the battle outcome. With this game , you can create,
     customize, and reconstruct Civil War battles. As much as
     possible, the game allows you freedom to not only play the
     scenarios, but also adjust the armies, and even modify most
     of the important aspects of the game itself.
     
     If you are not a registered user, you should become one and
     receive the latest version of the game, more scenarios,
     along with technical support. For details on how to
     register, see the file REGISTER.DOC.

      2 MAIN MENU & GAME PARAMETERS
     ===========================================================
      2.1  Main Menu
     ===============
     The main menu appears as shown below. Additional information
     is provided in the following paragraphs.
     
          +======================+
          |       MAIN MENU      |
          +======================+
          | Player : UNION       |
          | Load File            |
          | Save File            |
          | Fight                |
          | Parameters           |
          | Directory C:\CIVIL21 |
          | Scenario Editor      |
          | Quit                 |
          +======================+
     Menu options are selected by moving the highlighted bar over
     the desired choice (using up/down arrow keys) and pressing
     the 'Enter' key.
     
     The choices are:
     
     a. Select player (shows the current side selected and allows
        you to toggle between Union or Confederate side)
     

				- 3  -
 
     b. Load File (load EGA 'xxx.CIV' scenario file on current
        directory). A menu window will then appear listing the
        scenario files available on the current directory.
     
     c. Save file (save in-progress battle) Most scenarios will
        play quickly enough that you will not need this option.
        You will need to use F10 to return to the MAIN MENU to
        save a game once it has Provision for up to 5 saved games
        (named $AVE1.CIV through $AVE5.CIV). The date and time of
        the games is stamped when the file is saved to help in
        identifying the files. NOTE: If you save over another
        saved game, the older one will be overwritten.
     
     d. Fight (run a loaded battle file). Selecting this option
        will display the main battle screen (described elsewhere).
        Once the battle is begun, you may return to the main menu by
        pressing the F10 key when it is your turn to move.
     
     e. Adjust various game parameters. This gives you access to
        customize the game itself to meet your needs.
     
     f. Directory allows you to enter a new drive and directory.
        Press "Enter" after you have typed the desired drive and
        directory. When the main menu reappears, the new
        directory information will be displayed. If there is an
        error, the directory will not be changed.
     
     g. Option to go directly to the scenario editor, without
        having to exit to DOS. Be sure to save your game if you
        have one in progress.
     
     h. Quit option (allows you to exit the program).
     
        NOTE: All menus may be used by selecting desired option
              with arrow keys (up/down, 'Home' for top, 'End' for
              bottom) and pressing 'Enter'. A short cut is to
              enter the first letter of the desired command.
              'Escape' cancels the menu.
     
      2.2  2 Player Option
     =====================
     To choose this option, keep changing the SIDE option at the
     top of the main menu until it indicates "BOTH SIDES". Then
     load a scenario and begin to play as usual. When the first
     side finishes, the screen is redrawn, and you will be
     allowed to play the other side.
     
     This can be used for a 2 player game, with both players
     sitting at the keyboard. It is probably even better suited
     to allow one person to play both side to recreate an entire
     battle. The way the simulation is designed results in a lot
     of side changes, with some turns being very short. This
     means that is 2 people are playing there will be a lot of
     switching from one to the other. Also, when this option is
     selected, the RECON condition is turned ON, which means that
     movement is not hidden.

				- 4  -

     Each time the side changes, the number of total possible
     moves for that side for that turn is shown. This number is
     also displayed at the top right of the screen during the
     turn. The number of actual units that can actually be moved
     may be fewer, since some units may be "under orders" and
     will move automatically.
     
     Occasionally, one side will have no units that can be moved
     for a particular turn. In that case, the turn is advanced,
     and control is passed back to the other side.
     
     As a convenience to the second person, some additional keys
     can be used for important commands. The gray "*" key on the
     numeric keypad can be used as the "escape" key, to facilitate
     a second person sharing the keyboard, without having to reach
     all the way across the keyboard to reach the "Esc".
     
     Likewise, the gray "+" key  on the numeric keypad can be used
     as the "F" key to fire artillery.
     
      2.3  Game Parameters
     =====================
     CIVILWAR BATTLESET was designed for flexibility to suit your
     personal preference. Most of the important game parameters
     are available to you to customize as you wish. If you select
     the game parameter option, a sub menu will appear (as shown
     below) which allows you to select and adjust the parameters
     desired. Unless you save them in PREFER.CFG, they are set
     only for the duration of the game. Until they are adjusted,
     they will remain at a "normal" setting as specified by the
     current PREFER.CFG file.
     
          +=======================+
          | Set Game Parameters   |

          | Artillery Fire Rate:3 |
          | SAVE Settings         |
          +=======================+
     
     a. DIFFICULTY : Difficulty level makes your opponent either
        easier or harder to fight. If difficulty is low, the

				- 5  -
 
        enemy takes proportionately more losses, and is more
        likely to retreat. If difficulty level is high, the enemy
        takes fewer losses, and will tenaciously hold his ground.
        Difficulty ranges from 1 (very easy) to 5 (very hard) and
        is maintained in PREFER.CFG.
     
     b. ADJUST START POSITION : Adjusting the starting position
        randomizes the initial position of units slightly to
        provide variety in scenarios. Adjusting the start
        position will randomly shift unit locations slightly
        (both yours and the enemy's). This has no effect on the
        scenario file; only the game currently being played is
        affected. This is NOT maintained in the configuration
        file.
     
     c. VISIBILITY : Visibility affects the range at which units
        can see other units and fire on them with artillery. This
        is normally set at 18 spaces (a hex is 2 spaces). (See
        also Visibility and Movement).
     
     d. ENEMY AGGRESSION : The enemy is preset with an
        'aggression level' from 1 (very timid) to 5 (recklessly
        aggressive), which controls his likelihood of moving to
        engage and attack, and the intensity of his attacks. This
        can be adjusted to make the enemy either more or less
        aggressive. A more aggressive enemy will shift to the
        offensive and launch more and stronger attacks. A timid
        enemy will seek cover, launch weaker attacks, and play a
        more defensive-minded battle. Increased aggressiveness
        does not necessarily make the enemy harder to defeat, nor
        does more timidity mean he will be easier to defeat. Good
        defensive terrain, coupled with a less aggressive
        strategy, can be very effective.
     
     e. MESSAGE DISPLAY : Option to let you set how long messages
        are displayed. Previously if the sound option was turned
        off, some messages went by too fast for some users to
        read. Now you can play without the noises and still see
        what just happened. This can be set in 5 graduations from
        very fast (1) to very slow (5). The default setting is 3.
     
      NOTE: Anytime a message is being displayed in the game and
            you want to go on, simply hit a key. This works
            regardless of how long message are set to be
            displayed.
     
     f. SOUND : Option to let you toggle between SOUND and QUIET.
        This is mainly for the purpose of saving in your
        PREFER.CFG since the game has another toggle that is
        easier to access when it is in progress. (See GAME
        OPTIONS menu).
     
     g. SCORING FACTORS : You can adjust the some of the factors
        used in scoring the game. These factors are:
     
        Number of enemy casualties caused...... 1 point

				- 6  -
 
        Number of enemy units eliminated....... x points
        Number of turns Objective controlled... y points
        Bonus: Objective held on last turn..... z points
        Bonus: Annihilating All Enemy Units.. 250 points (fixed)
     
        Initially x is 5 points, y is 10 points, and z is 100
        points. You should be careful not to vary these values
        too much from the initial values. Very large scoring
        factors may result in numbers too large to compute,
        causing an overflow error.
     
     h. UNIT RELIABILITY : Leaders in the Civil War often acted
        on local initiative rather than following the original
        plan. This is simulated through unit reliability. A very
        reliable unit will always follow your orders exactly. A
        very unreliable unit will be difficult to control, and
        will often charge in directions and engage in fights you
        didn't intend. This tendency can be somewhat frustrating
        (although realistic) and can be adjusted from (100%
        reliable) to 5 (maverick). The default is 3, which
        provides some of the challenge of controlling the units
        without being reduced to the role of spectator.
     
        A option is provided a truly 'absolutely reliable'
        setting. However, this override prevents issuing 'move to
        location' orders when units are set on maximum
        reliability. The override essentially clears ALL move
        orders a unit might have prior to its turn.
     
     i. A computer vs. computer option has been provided to help
        in evaluating playability/balance of scenarios you
        design. You must first load a scenario, then select  the
        "Computer vs. Computer" option. Sound is automatically
        turned OFF and message delays are set at minimum level to
        make this play as fast as possible. The RECON option is
        turned ON to allow you to view all units in play. (Note
        that units that have not yet arrived will NOT be shown
        until their time of arrival). The elapsed time used (real
        time) is displayed as the game progresses. Play should
        proceed very rapidly.
     
        Although the computer plays both sides using the same
        logic rules, it displays the score from the point of view
        of the side you have chosen (in your preference file).
     
        To interrupt the computer vs. computer game in progress,
        press AND HOLD F10 until the opening menu appears.
        (Control-Break will not interrupt the game). However,
        once the automatic computer vs. computer mode is begun,
        you CANNOT toggle to the normal fight mode from the
        opening menu. If you wish to play a game normally after
        you have used this option, you should restart the
        program.
     
     j. The STACK LIMIT can be adjusted in increments of 500
        from a stack limit of 0 (no stacking permitted) to
        2000. The default is 500.

				- 7  -
     k. Artillery LIMBER toggle : The default setting is ON,
        which means that artillery must be limbered to move and
        unlimbered to fire. (See unit information for
        instructions on limbering/unlimbering artillery).
     
     l. Artillery LINE OF SIGHT toggle : The default setting is
        ON, which means that artillery must have a clear line of
        sight to target an enemy.  (See unit information for more
        detail on how line of sight is determined).
     
     m. Artillery CAPTURE option toggle : The default setting is
        ON, which means that some portion of eliminated artillery
        units may be captured. (See COMBAT section below for a
        more complete explanation).
     
     n. HISTORY toggle : The default setting is ON, which means
        that game high scores will be reported and saved (file
        MAXSKORS), as well as the cumulative performance of each
        commander (file GENERALZ).
     
     o. ARTILLERY FIRE RATE : Artillery rate of fire can be
        adjusted in the PARAMETERS menu from 1 (very slow) to 5
        (very fast). This setting applies to all artillery pieces
        in the battle. Default setting is 3 (moderate).
     
     o. SAVE SETTINGS : Option to create a new PREFER.CFG file.
        The setting will be displayed on the title screen when
        the game is started.
     
      2.4  Screen Blank Function
     ===========================
     A screen blank function has been added, activated by
     "Ctrl-B". The game screen will be replaced by a blank screen
     with a C:> prompt. To go back to the game type "Ctrl-B"
     again.

      3.2   Battle Map
     =================
     The battle map is based on a hexagonal layout, 27 hexes wide
     by 20 hexes high, with terrain features shown by EGA graphic
     icons. More complete information is provided on-line via the
     F1 help key.

      3.3  'Terrain' Command
     =======================
     A "T" (for Terrain) command has been added to show the
     terrain without units. This temporarily toggles the unit
     icons off, then replaces all visible units after you have
     viewed the terrain.
     
      3.4   Armies Summary Data
     ==========================
     The number of turns remaining in the battle is shown in the
     top section of this zone. A summary is given of the total
     losses incurred by each army and the number of turns each
     side has controlled the objective. The side you are playing
     is indicated by a '' character. The side currently
     controlling the objective is indicated by a '' character.
     
      3.5   Active Unit Data
     =======================
     A summary is given for the player-controlled unit that is
     active, showing unit number, unit name, unit type, current
     strength, terrain, leadership, and morale. In addition, the
     time the unit will next be available for movement is shown.
     If the unit is under 'orders', the message "ORDERS" will
     appear next to the unit number. The message "DUG IN" appears
     for entrenched units. The unit displayed is available for
     moving, is attacking, is being attacked, or is being
     'scanned' by the cursor.
     
      3.6   Message Window
     =====================

				- 9  -
 
     The message window provides comments on battle maneuvers and
     outcomes as they occur. It also shows when the enemy
     (computer) is taking its turn. At the very beginning of the
     game, the enemy will take a longer turn as he sets his
     overall strategy. Afterwards, enemy turns will be quicker.
     
     ===========================================================
      4 UNIT TYPES & ATTRIBUTES
     ===========================================================
      4.1   Unit Types
     =================
     There are 4 basic unit types, Infantry, Artillery, Cavalry,
     and Generals. Artillery has 4 main subtypes: Rifled
     Artillery, Napoleons (smoothbore), Horse Artillery, and
     Emplaced Guns (stationary). In addition.  there are Boat
     units (representing gunboats) which are a special form of
     artillery. They are shown on the display by distinctive
     "standard" military icons, in gray for Confederate units and
     blue for Union units. (Press 'F1' to get a full display of
     icons, terrain features and effects, and hot key commands).

     (smooth                           distance; less range and
      bores)                           accuracy than rifled artillery,
                                       but more effective at close
                                       range targets due to use of

                                       units; can inspire units

                             boats)
     
      4.2   Unit Attributes
     ======================
     Each unit has the following attributes:
     
       Attribute     Limits               Influences
       ---------    -------              ------------
       Unit number   1-80                Identifier only
       Name          16 characters max   Identifier only
       Unit Type     I,è,A,N,H,C,G,B     Combat, move, & other
       Strength      depends on type     Combat
       Leadership    10-110              Combat, move, & other
       Morale        10-110              Combat, move, & other
     
     Units which have leadership lower than about 50-60 are
     poorly led, and will have difficulty in movement and combat.
     Likewise, units with morale less than about 50-60 will not
     be very effective, and should be rested if possible. Units
     with morale lower than 60 cannot use the 'charge' option.
     
     During the heat of battle, morale and leadership may briefly
     go outside the ranges shown.
     
      4.3   Generals
     ===============
     A General unit greatly improves the fighting abilities of
     adjacent units, both attack and defense. In addition, Generals
     have a powerful ability to iNspire units into action. However,
     you must be careful in actually engaging General unit itself,
     since it is usually relatively weak (which reduces combat
     effectiveness).
     
      4.4   Cancel Orders
     ====================
     Sometimes in the thick of battle you will have units engaged
     in combat (and not moving) or with movement orders which you
     need to redirect. To cancel existing orders for all friendly
     units, type 'X' when a General unit has its turn. As
     described earlier, this is not 100% effective (some units
     will ignore it) and may cause morale and leadership to suffer
     in units that do comply.
     
     Friendly units that are "under orders" are indicated on the
     map as units WITHOUT a contrasting color border. For
     instance, Union units normally have a light blue border, but
     Union units currently under orders do not have the border.
     
     When a General cancels orders, units that obey will flash

				- 11  -
 
     briefly after the order is issued. Then a message indicates
     how many units obeyed out of the total currently 'under
     orders'. This allows you to see whether you need to issue
     additional commands to cancel orders.
     
     The "cancel orders" option shows how many units FAILED to
     obey orders and thus are still on local command. Using this
     in conjunction with the intelligence option change allows
     more control over units.
     
      4.5   Inspire Units
     ====================
     General units may issue an iNspire command to rally another
     individual unit. The hot key for this command is 'N' (for
     iNspire). Using this command, a General unit may activate
     another unit nearby IF the target unit meets all these
     conditions:
     
     (a) unit is close enough - maximum distance is .5 of the
         visibility limit set for the game
     (b) the sum of the General's leadership and morale factors
         is greater than the sum of the target unit's leadership
         and morale.
     (c) unit's next move will occur within 10 turns
     
     The General unit does not move when iNspiring another unit.
     The target unit has its time of next action set to the
     current turn. The General unit has its time of next action
     set to the time the target unit WOULD HAVE moved. The target
     unit gains 5 morale points; the General unit loses 7 morale
     points.
     
     If the target unit is too far to communicate, there is no
     penalty.
     
     If the General unit has insufficient leadership and morale
     to inspire the target unit, the General loses 7 morale
     points AND 5 leadership points due to the loss of respect.
     If the target unit's time of next action is more than 10
     turns away, the General unit suffers the loss of 7 morale
     points.
     
     The "iNspired" unit normally will activate and be ready to
     move within the same turn. In effect, the General unit has
     passed its movement turn to another unit (by exhorting and
     inspiring them into action). This allows you to rally
     worn-out troops for one last action (e.g., to seize the
     objective).
     
      4.6   Group Move-to-Location Orders
     ====================================
     General units may order several nearby units to move to a
     destination by issuing a group move-to-location order. The
     hot key for this command is F6. More information on this
     command is given in the visibility & movement section.
     

				- 12  -
 
     ===========================================================
      5 VISIBILITY & MOVEMENT
     ===========================================================
      5.1   Visibility
     =================
     All your friendly units are visible, but enemy units are not
     always visible. Enemy units do not become visible until they
     are within a certain visibility range from friendly units.
     The visibility range is calculated from a base visibility
     range (set in the battle data file), and adjusted based on
     the terrain occupied by both the friendly unit and the enemy
     unit. If your unit occupies a mountain or hill it has
     increased ability to see enemy units; while occupying a
     forest or swamp, it has decreased ability to see enemy
     units. If the enemy is in a forest, he is much more
     difficult to see, and your unit must be closer. Enemies that
     move into forests may disappear from view. The base
     visibility range may be altered (see Game Parameters
     section).
     
      5.2   Movement
     ===============
     When one of your units is ready to move, it will be
     highlighted and a short tone will sound. At that point, you
     have several command options as described in the paragraphs
     below. If the unit is entrenched, you will be prompted to
     confirm that you want it to move. If you do not confirm the
     move, the unit automatically is Rested.
     
      5.3  Controlling Diagonal Moves
     ================================
     Diagonal movement is supported in this game, using the numeric
     key pad, with NUMLOCK turned OFF, as shown below:
     
                         +------+------+------+
                         |  7   |  8   |  9   |
      Move UP & LEFT ----->     |      |     <----- Move UP & RIGHT
                         | Home |      | PgUp |
                         +------+------+------+
                         |  4   |  5   |  6   |
         Move LEFT ------->     |      |     <----- Move RIGHT
                         |      |      |      |
                         +------+------+------+
                         |  1   |  2   |  3   |
      Move DOWN & LEFT --->     |      |     <----- Move DOWN & RIGHT
                         | End  |      | PgDn |
                         +------+------+------+
     
     Note that this scheme is required because the map is hex-based.
     The game will respond to the Up or Down moves (either on the
     numeric keypad, or the "inverted T" arrows), but since there are
     no directly up or down moves on the map, it must convert them to
     a diagonal move, which is done on a 50%-50% random basis, either
     left or right.
     
     TO BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE EAST-WEST DIRECTION OF NORTH-SOUTH

				- 13  -
 
     MOVEMENT, YOU MUST USE THE NUMERIC KEYPAD.
     
      5.4   Single Hex Movement
     ==========================
     You may move the unit to an adjacent unoccupied hex by using
     the appropriate arrow key (numeric key pad). Since the unit
     may not move directly up or down on the hexagonal map, the
     'up' or 'down' keys are reinterpreted as diagonal 'up' or
     'down' moves. You cannot control whether these reinterpreted
     diagonal moves are right or left (done randomly), so you
     should generally avoid using the 'up' and 'down' keys for
     single hex movement.
     
     If you attempt to move into a prohibited hex (occupied or
     water), a tone will sound. There is no movement penalty.
     
     After the unit moves, it may reveal enemy units that were
     previously hidden.
     
     Any units that were entrenched at the beginning of the
     scenario (using the scenario editor) may be reluctant to
     move from the safety of their trenches. Occasionally such
     units will not respond to move orders (a message to that
     effect is displayed). Units that are low on morale or that
     are poorly led are more likely to do this.
     
      5.5   Move-to-Location Orders
     ==============================
     Single hex movement may be tedious. You may wish to give
     your units orders to move to a particular location instead.
     To do this, press 'M' when the unit is highlighted and a
     cursor will appear on top of the unit. Move this cursor with
     the arrow keys to the desired destination, and press
     'Enter'. When the "move to" order is issued, the destination
     is will be indicated by a small white circle and a line will
     connect the unit with its intended target. On its next turn,
     your unit will then begin to move to the selected
     destination, following the most direct path. (It will not
     necessarily follow the same path you used in moving the
     cursor to the destination). If it is blocked by a friendly
     unit or by prohibited terrain (water or edge of map screen),
     or if the unit is attacked in any way, the movement order
     will be cancelled, and the unit will wait for new
     instructions.
     
     Artillery units must be LIMBERED (or the limber option must
     be turned off) to respond to move-to-location orders. Orders
     can be issued to unlimbered artillery, but the orders are
     ignored, and the unit will not move. This applies to the
     special group move-to-location orders issued by General
     units as well. Emplaced artillery can not receive
     move-to-location orders.
     
     For destinations that are far away, moving the cursor may be
     speeded by holding down 'Shift' before pressing the desired
     arrow key. The cursor will then move to the indicated map

				- 14  -
 
     edge. Pressing the '5' key at the center of the key pad will
     center the cursor on the screen.
     
     Once a unit has reached its assigned destination, it will
     flash and a tone will sound, along with a message that it
     has arrived at its destination. At that point its orders are
     cancelled, and it will await further instructions.
     
     While units are 'under orders' to move you will not normally
     be able to access them, even if you change your mind about
     what they should do. The only way you can overcome this is
     having one of your General units cancel the unit orders
     using the 'X' command. (See 'hot keys' section). This is not
     100% effective (due to communication breakdowns and stubborn
     subordinate officers). Even if the orders are actually
     cancelled, morale and leadership may be reduced in units
     affected due to the conflicts between unit commanders and
     General unit. Thus, the 'cancel orders' option should be
     used only as needed to free units that have become locked in
     combat.
     
     Since the General units are your only means to cancel
     orders, you should usually not give them movement orders.
     That way, you will be able to access them more frequently.
     
     Though your units will normally wait for your commands, on
     occasion they will decide to move on their own initiative
     (generally in an attempt to engage an enemy unit which they
     have sighted). Such units issue their own orders to move to
     the chosen destination. You can choose to adjust the
     tendency of your troops to do act on their own by setting
     the 'Reliability' level in the 'Game Parameters' menu.
     
      5.6   Group Move-to-Location Orders
     ====================================
     A General unit ONLY may order a group of nearby units to
     move to a destination. To activate this feature, press F6
     when a General unit is highlighted and awaiting your
     command. A cursor will appear as described in the
     Move-to-Location option above. Move the cursor to the
     target destination and press 'Enter'. The number of nearby
     units that plan to obey the order is given in the screen
     message. Units must be no further away than half the
     visibility limit to receive the order. Likewise, in order to
     obey the order, the unit must not be 'under orders'. Note
     that the General unit himself does not go 'under orders',
     only those OTHER UNITS that comply with his orders.
     
      5.7   Charge
     =============
     Infantry units ONLY may double their speed for short
     distances on OPEN TERRAIN OR ROADS only with a 'C' (CHARGE)
     command. Units in 'charge' mode will be shown with a
     distinctive icon. While in 'charge' mode they will move
     twice as fast as normal infantry.
     

				- 15  -
 
     If charging units become involved in combat, or are attacked
     by artillery, or move into any other than open or roads
     terrain, they will switch out of 'charge' mode. In addition,
     each time a unit in 'charge' mode is moved, there is a
     chance that the unit will simply become too tired to
     continue the charge. Units that are moved until they are too
     tired will be delayed in their action for a time while they
     rest.
     
     The 'charge' option affects both movement and combat
     (increases 'shock' effect of attacks). Units with too low
     morale will not be able to charge at all until their morale
     improves.
     
     Note that switching to 'charge' mode requires one turn. Then
     the unit may be moved a single hex or given orders.
     
      5.8   Rest
     ===========
     You may not wish to move a unit on its turn. By pressing the
     space bar you can skip the unit and allow it to rest for a
     few turns. If the unit's morale is low, it will improve
     slightly after resting.
     
      5.9   Wait
     ===========
     To avoid having to repeatedly issue a 'Rest' order, an
     option is provided whereby units may 'Wait'. Press 'W' when
     the unit has its turn. The unit icon will change to a solid
     colored block. The unit will become inactive, automatically
     resting to regain morale. The unit will reactivate if
     attacked (either melee or cannonade). Waiting units suffer
     no penalty if attacked.
     
     In addition, you may activate the WAITing unit at any time
     another friendly unit has a turn. Press 'I' for the
     intelligence cursor and pass it over the inactive unit you
     wish to wake. The icon will change to the normal icon. Now
     press 'esc' and the first unit can take whatever action you
     wish.
     
      5.10  Stacking
     ===============
     Normally, units cannot move onto other friendly units
     (stack). However, units can now be stacked under certain
     conditions:
     
        (a) TOTAL unit strength resulting from stacking must be
            stack limit or less (stack limit default is 500)
        (b) If dissimilar units are stacked, an INFANTRY unit
            will result, unless one of the units is a
            GENERAL, in which case a GENERAL will result
     
     The leadership value for the stacked unit will usually be the
     higher of the two units that are being combined. An exception is
     if one of the units is a General and the other is not; in that

				- 16  -
 
     case, the resulting leadership value is always that of the
     General unit.
     
     Morale will generally INCREASE slightly if LIKE units are
     stacked. It will generally DECREASE slightly if UNLIKE units are
     stacked.
     
     Stacking results in a time delay for the unit to get reorganized.
     The reorganization delay is reduced if leadership is high.
     
      5.11 'Join' Command to Check Stacking Options
     ==============================================
     The 'J' (for 'JOIN') option allows a unit to check for other
     units it might combine with, given the current stack limit. All
     units which the unit in question could join will be displayed (if
     any), while all other friendly units will temporarily be blanked
     out.
     
     ===========================================================
      6 COMBAT
     ===========================================================
      6.1   Normal Combat
     ====================
     Units can attack enemy units in an adjacent hex. To do so,
     attempt to move the selected unit on top of the enemy. A
     menu will appear in the 'Armies Summary Data' zone of the
     screen showing the attack options. Four different
     intensities of attack are permitted:
     
              Option         Relative Intensity
          --------------     ------------------
          Light Skirmish             1
          Medium Fight               2
          Heavy Attack               3
          All-Out Assault            8
     
     Note the 'All-Out Assault' is just that, and that it should
     be used relatively sparingly, since it will result in heavy
     casualties for BOTH sides. If you do not wish to attack at
     all, you may cancel the attack by pressing the 'escape' key;
     however, that will forfeit the unit's turn for the current
     round (the price paid for indecision).
     
     Normally your units will wait for you to issue an attack
     order. However, they may occasionally attack on their own
     initiative. When this happens, you will receive a message in
     the 'Message Window' zone, and the attack intensity menu
     will appear for you to select the intensity, as described
     above. Pressing 'Esc' will abort the attack for now, but the
     unit will miss its turn.
     
     When units become engaged in combat, they are somewhat
     'locked in place', and their ability to respond to orders is
     reduced. They also are more likely to act on their own
     initiative, to renew the combat without any orders to do so.
     

				- 17  -
 
      6.2   Artillery
     ================
     Artillery ('A','B','E', 'H', or 'N') units may bombard
     visible enemy units some distance away, rather than melee
     adjacent units (which they do very poorly anyway). To fire
     the cannons, press 'F' (for 'FIRE') when the artillery unit
     is given its turn to move. (If LIMBER option is ON, you will
     be prompted to unlimber first)
     
     When you fire artillery, a cursor will appear. Also, the
     range of the cannon and the current distance to target is
     displayed in the 'Message Window'. If the cursor is moved
     out of range of the cannon, the distance will be highlighted
     (to remind you it is out of range). You may move the cursor
     using the key pad (as described earlier for unit movement)
     to the selected target, then press 'Enter'. Both the firing
     cannon battery and the defending unit are highlighted until
     the results are displayed in the 'Message Window' and in the
     'Armies Summary'.
     
     When firing artillery, the valid enemy targets only will be
     visible during the firing phase. Valid targets must be in
     range. Additionally,if the line of sight option is ON, they
     must also be in line of sight. ALL visible enemy units will
     reappear after firing.
     
     Range of the artillery depends on the same factors as
     visibility (elevation and cover). Rifled artillery ('A' and
     'E') is more effective at longer ranges than smoothbore
     napoleons ('N'). Horse artillery ('H') is lighter and more
     mobile than either and causes less damage.
     
     An 'EMPLACED GUN' unit type has been added to allow for
     fixed, fortified gun positions. These are treated as very
     heavy rifled artillery for the purpose of range and damage.
     For a given artillery unit strength, EMPLACED GUNS will do
     more damage than any other artillery type. They fire at a
     slightly slower rate than other rifled cannons, however.
     EMPLACED GUNS can not retreat or otherwise move. They can be
     captured if the 'artillery capture' option is activated.
     
     Enemy artillery will concentrate more fire on units that
     threaten the artillery unit (especially those immediately
     adjacent). Damage from canister fire at close range is often
     devastating. This makes artillery units tough to overrun, if
     they have a chance to fire.
     
     There is a (low) probability of artillery exploding and
     killing members of the firing battery.
     
      6.3   Line of Sight
     ====================
     The line of sight option restricts artillery units to fire
     only at enemy units not blocked by obstructing terrain
     features. Line of sight is considered by tracing an
     approximate straight line path from the firing unit to the

				- 18  -
 
     enemy (while keeping to the map hexes). Line of sight is
     traced until an obstruction is encountered. If there are no
     obstructions, the line of sight is reported as clear.
     Otherwise, the artillery unit cannot see the enemy and is
     prohibited from firing at that target.
     
     Trees, villages, hills and mountains are considered
     obstructions. Army units are NOT considered as obstructions.
     
     A firing unit on a hill may see over ONE obstructed hex with
     a forest or village (but not any additional obstructed
     hexes). A firing unit on a hill cannot see over a hill or
     mountain.
     
     A firing unit on a mountain may see over TWO obstructed
     forest or village hexes. A firing unit on a mountain can see
     over ONE hill, but never over another mountain.
     
     The line of sight option can be toggled on or off as desired
     in the game parameter menu. Because gunboats will generally
     have a more unobstructed view, they have an increased line
     of sight ability vs. land based artillery.
     
      6.4  'View' Command to Check Line of Sight
     ===========================================
     Any unit may check for visible enemy units within line of
     sight from the location of the checking unit by typing 'V'
     (for 'VIEW'). This helps you scout where to set up your
     artillery. Visible terrain hexes are shown in reverse color,
     as are visible friendly units. Enemy units visible to the
     checking unit are shown in normal colors. Enemy units that
     are not visible to the checking unit are not displayed until
     you press a key.
     
      6.5   Limbering Artillery
     ==========================
     A 'limber' feature is provided to add realism by requiring
     all land-based artillery units (Artillery-Rifled, Napoleon,
     and Horse Artillery) to limber before being moved and to
     unlimber before being fired. The 'L' hot key will toggle
     land-based artillery units between limbered and unlimbered
     states. A LIMBERED unit is represented on the map by an open
     circle (think of it as a "wheel") and its unit description
     has an 'L' in front of the name (e.g. LNapoleon). Unlimbered
     units are represented by icons as in the regular game.
     Changing between limbered/unlimbered requires 5 additional
     turns. In addition, units with morale less than 60 require
     an additional 5 turns to change.
     
     The feature is activated via a toggle in the 'Game
     Parameters' and-based artillery units (Artillery-Rifled,
     Napoleon, and Horse Artillery) to limber before being moved
     and to unlimber before being fired. When the limber feature
     is ON, you cannot move unlimbered artillery units nor fire
     limbered units.
     

				- 19  -
 
     Limbered artillery is extremely vulnerable to attack, either
     melee or artillery fire. Limbered artillery is very
     ineffective in melee attack.
     
     If limber option is set ON, all unlimbered artillery unit
     types cannot retreat until they are limbered. This means
     unlimbered artillery units simply have to take the punishment
     while they are under attack.
     
      6.6   Cannonade
     ================
     Attacks by artillery (cannonades) are a special type of
     combat. The outcome depends on the strength of the attacking
     unit, the strength of the defending unit, the terrain, and
     luck. Given the more uncertain nature of this form of
     combat, the outcomes are more variable. However, in the long
     run cannonades will cause considerable damage. Cannonades
     against units immediately next to the artillery unit will
     cause twice the normal damage, as the defenders receive
     canister fire at pointblank range. Napoleon units are even
     more effective in pointblank attacks due to their use of
     canister (grapeshot).
     
      6.7   Cavalry Charge
     =====================
     When cavalry in a CLEAR or ROAD hex attacks an enemy also in
     a CLEAR of ROAD hex, the cavalry may 'charge' (receive an
     attack bonus). The charge option is automatically put into
     effect and a special message will announce it. Note that
     bridge hexes do not allow charges due to the constricted
     space.
     
      6.8   Resolving Combat
     =======================
     In resolving the combat, the attacker goes first, then the
     defender. While the attacker is attacking, the defender's
     terrain is used in determining defender casualties. When the
     defender returns fire, the attacker's terrain is used in
     determining extent of attacker casualties.
     
     Attacking is risky business, since the attacker must expose
     himself, while the defender can take advantage of whatever
     cover is available. Thus, attackers will generally take
     proportionally more casualties. The results will be
     displayed as the battle progresses in the 'Armies Summary'
     area and in the 'Message Window'. Morale of both armies
     under fire will decrease.
     
      6.9   Combat Results
     =====================
     The primary factors affecting combat results are shown
     below:

				- 20  -
      Factor               Relative Effect
      -----                ---------------------
      Intensity .......... Major
      Unit Strength ...... Major
      Unit Leadership .... Moderate (major if very low)
      Unit Morale ........ Moderate (major if very low)
      Terrain ............ Moderate (major for some
      (see note)                     conditions, such as cavalry
                                     in swamps)
      Unit Type .......... Moderate (major if Artillery or
                                     General units directly
                                     involved in combat)
      Adjacent Friendly .. Moderate
      General
      LUCK ............... Slight-Moderate
      Adjacent Friendly
      Unit ............... Slight
     
      NOTE: The terrain occupied by BOTH combatants is considered
      in adjusting combat outcome. A unit is at a disadvantage in
      swamps, but is at an advantage in forest or hill hexes. A
      unit is at a considerable advantage on mountains or in fort
      hexes. Cavalry and Artillery units (all types) are
      particularly disadvantaged in swamps, and somewhat
      disadvantaged in forests. Entrenchment (if any) is also
      considered. Entrenched units gain a bonus in addition to any
      terrain effect.
     
      6.10  Retreat
     ==============
     If a unit takes particularly heavy casualties, and
     leadership and morale are sufficiently low, it will decide
     to retreat. When this happens, the unit attempts to move to
     one of the 3 hexes furthest from the attacker. The selected
     hex must be an unoccupied hex. When a unit attempts to pull
     back, a message will appear and the unit will appear in
     purple. When an army retreats, its morale suffers, and it
     takes a few additional casualties as wounded men are
     captured.
     
     Since pulling back means exposure to enemy fire, units will
     take additional casualties when they decide to retreat.
     Units that are cut off and unable to retreat will take
     particularly heavy additional losses in the confusion.
     Botched retreats will also reduce effectiveness of unit
     leadership.
     
     Sometimes the enemy unit will have to retreat as well, if it
     has taken heavy losses. In some instances, one unit in
     combat will have to retreat while the victor has not taken
     much damage. The victorious unit may advance to pursue the
     fleeing unit. Morale increases for the pursuing unit;
     leadership may also improve, as the commander hones his
     skills.
     
     The human attacker is given the option to pursue if
     reliability setting is normal or better (instead of
     automatically pursuing).

				- 21  -
     
      6.11 Killed Leaders
     ====================
     Occasionally, the unit commander himself will be killed in
     the combat. When this happens, a message to that effect will
     appear in the 'Message Window'. The leadership ability of
     the new leader will be displayed. It will usually (but not
     always) be lower than the deceased commander.
     
      6.12 Eliminated Units
     ======================
     Occasionally units will be eliminated from the battle. This
     is announced in the message window and an "death's head"
     icon will appear in the hex the eliminated unit occupied.
     When this happens, the opponent is awarded additional
     victory points (as established in the scoring factors) for
     eliminating the unit.
     
     If one side is completely annihilated by having ALL of its
     units eliminated, the game will end. A bonus of 250 points
     is awards to the victor in this case.
     
      6.13 Capturing Artillery
     =========================
     In the case of eliminated artillery, some portion of the
     eliminated unit may be captured by the attacker. This will
     occur if: (a) The "artillery capture" option is ON (b) There
     is an unused unit number for the attacking side for the new
     artillery unit that will be formed. (c) The attacker chooses
     to pursue into the hex where the eliminated unit had been.
     The option to capture occurs only when the artillery unit is
     eliminated. Otherwise, the unit is permanently removed from
     the remainder of the game.
     
      6.14 End of Game
     =================
     The game ends when time expires or one side is annihilated. The
     side controlling the objective at the end gets a bonus as
     explained earlier.
     
     When time expires, you are given an option to allow you continue
     to play 10 more turns even though the scenario has ended. The
     side controlling the objective gets the end-game bonus each time
     this option is chosen, even though the game continues. Scenarios
     may be extended indefinitely using this option.
     
     ===========================================================
      7 HOT KEY COMMANDS
     ===========================================================
      7.1   Hot Keys
     ===============
     In addition to the movement and combat commands, there are
     several commands available during the battle. Some of these
     are accessed through the menus described later. Most can be
     reached using 'hot keys' as described below.

     * When RECON is activated, ALL enemy units currently in the
       battle will become visible, even if they are out of
       visibility range. Eliminated units and units that are
       delayed and have not yet appeared in the battle will NOT be
       revealed.

      8 OTHER COMMANDS - MENUS
     ===========================================================
      8.1   Unit Command Menu
     ========================
     This menu is accessed by pressing the F2 key when one of
     your units is waiting for orders (is highlighted).
     
               Menu           Hot key Equivalent
     +==================+
     | UNIT COMMAND     |

      8.2  Move to Location
     ======================
     This option is described in the Visibility and Movement section
     above. Note that the group move to location option is not
     available from the Unit Command menu.
     
      8.3  Intelligence
     ==================
     This option causes cursor to appear on your highlighted
     unit. The cursor may be moved to get strength and terrain
     information on any unit that is currently visible. Press
     'esc' when done. Placing the cursor over a friendly unit
     will display that unit's current status in the 'active unit
     data' window.
     
     If the friendly unit under the cursor is WAITed, it will
     activate on its next time of action. (Note that this may not
     be immediately).
     
     Intelligence is useful to identify units that are weak or
     are bogged down by terrain or combat and not likely to move
     very soon. When doing an intelligence scan of friendly units
     that are 'under orders' to go to a specific location, that
     location is shown on the map and with a line connected to
     the unit.
     
     Use of the Intelligence command does not cost a turn. This
     gives the human player more information in selecting units
     to attack.
     
      8.4  Rest
     ==========
     This option is described in elsewhere. The Wait option
     allows units to repeatedly rest.
     
      8.5  Game Options
     ==================
     This is another way to the game menu option (see below).
     
      8.6  (special options)
     =======================
     This option will appear only if a General, Artillery, or
     Infantry type unit is waiting for orders. It will give these
     options:
     
                Cancel Orders   (General)
                Fire            (Artillery)
                Charge          (Infantry)
     
     Note that all of these may be directly accessed using the
     appropriate 'hot key'. In addition, the 'W', 'N', and 'F6'
     commands may ONLY be accessed by hot keys.
     
      8.7  Game Options
     ==================
     This menu is displayed by pressing the F3 key, or via the

				- 24  -
 
     unit command menu.

     | Briefing           |         ---
     +====================+
     
      8.8  Order of Battle ('O')
     ===========================
     This option gives a detailed listing of all your units and
     their status, as well as listings of known (visible) enemy
     units. While the information for your own units is accurate,
     it is only approximately correct for enemy units. Units in
     trouble will be shown in red.
     
      8.9  Game Score ('G')
     ======================
     This option gives the current game score. The score depends
     on the scoring factors and the current game status. Scoring
     depends on relative casualties, number of units eliminated,
     and number of turns of control of the objective. (A ''
     character will appear in the 'Armies Summary Data' zone next
     to the word 'Objective' for the army controlling the
     objective). The objective is 'controlled' by moving a
     friendly unit onto the 'é' character on the battle map. ONCE
     OCCUPIED, THE OBJECTIVE REMAINS UNDER CONTROL UNTIL AN ENEMY
     MOVES ONTO IT - you do not have to CONTINUE to occupy the
     objective to get further credit for control.
     
      8.10 Screen Redraw ('S')
     =========================
     This option redraws the screen.
     
      8.11 Briefing
     ==============
     Information on the battle (background, objectives,
     commanders, special problems, significance, etc.) will be
     provided if it is available in the scenario.
     
     ===========================================================
      9 NOTES
     ===========================================================
      9.1  Realism
     =============
     Liberties have been taken with time, distance, movement, and
     unit attributes in the scenarios provided, in the interest
     of simplicity and game playability. However, the historical
     scenarios have been researched and play tested for
     correspondence to actual results.

				- 25  -
      9.2  Time
     ==========
     You cannot give orders to every unit on every turn as the
     game progresses. This is unlike some other war games, where
     each unit can move each turn, but units move different
     numbers of spaces.
     
     In this game, movement is always one space, but the
     different unit movements take different amounts of time  due
     to unit type, terrain, leadership and morale factors. In my
     mind this more closely simulates the confusion of battles at
     a tactical level, and still allows the game to be easily
     played. Fast moving units will still move fast (they get
     MORE TURNS!) but cannot dash 5 hexes to the objective on a
     single turn while all other units are in suspended
     animation.
     
     In the included scenarios, a time unit may be considered
     about 3-5 minutes.
     
      9.3  Distance & Other Factors
     ==============================
     Hexes are about 150 yards each, making game map about 2
     miles (high) by 5 miles (wide). An infantry unit can travel
     at a normal pace 10 hexes (1 mile) in about 40 turns (1/2 -
     1 hour). In 'Charge' mode an infantry unit can travel at
     twice the normal pace (for short distances only).
     
     Civil war artillery pieces were quite varied, but a range of
     about a mile (20 spaces or 10 hexes) is not unreasonable.
     Most of the effective firing will done at targets that are
     closer.
     
     Unit strengths are intended to be relative approximations
     only. All these factors can be modified as desired, either
     in the design of the scenario, or through the game
     parameters.
