            CIVILSET v2.4 - EGA Scenario Setup/Editor
     ===========================================================

     ===========================================================
      1.1   Introduction
     ===================
     This CIVILSET editor allows you to create, modify, and save
     battle scenarios for the EGA version of CIVILWAR BATTLE SET.
     A scenario is a combination of battle map (with terrain
     features and battlefield objective),armies, and description.
     Scenarios (xxx.CIV) files are saved as "flat" ASCII files
     and with  practice you may choose to use a word processor or
     text editor to directly modify the files.
     
     The scenario files allow up to 40 units per side. The game
     program MUST have all files in the new format (version 1.4
     or later). If you have any files developed in the old
     format, you MUST convert them to the new format before using
     them. (See below for how to do this).
     
     The editor requires the following files:
     TERRAIN.EGA -¿
     STDICON.EGA -Å Icon Files MUST be present
     MISC.EGA    -Ù
     UNION.LDR - 15 prominent Union leaders and ability ratings*
     REBEL.LDR - 15 prominent Rebel leaders and ability ratings*
     MONTHS.DAT -   dates for random scenarios
     PNAMES1.DAT -  place names for random scenarios
     PNAMES2.DAT -  more place names for random scenarios
     RNAMES.DAT -   Rebel unit names for random scenarios
     YNAMES.DAT -   Union unit names for random scenarios
     
     * The two *.LDR files are simple ASCII files and can be
     modified with a text editor. The only requirement is that
     the total number of leaders in each file MUST be 15 and that
     the each individual entry is in the format:
     
     "leader name",ability #
     
     The leader name can be no more than 16 characters. The
     leadership ability score must be in the range of 10-110.

      2.2   Initial (Blank) Scenario
     ===============================
     This option zeros all army units and provides a blank game
     map (all 'clear' hexes). Use it to create entirely new
     scenarios.
     
      2.3   Load Scenario
     ====================
     This option provides you with a list of the xxx.CIV battle
     scenario files that are on the current directory, to allow
     you to select one to load. File selection is done via menu,
     by moving the cursor up or down with the "arrow keys" on the
     key pad, then pressing "Enter" to make a selection of the
     hilighted item.
     
      2.4   Save Scenario
     ====================
     Before saving the file, you will be prompted to provide the
     battle name and time limit if you have not already done so.
     You will also be prompted for the file name (1-8 characters
     identifying the file on the directory). If you use a name
     already in use, the old file will be overwritten. YOU DO NOT
     NEED TO PROVIDE THE ".CIV" EXTENDER. Messages will advise
     you of the status of the file save.

      3.1  MAP Edit
     ==============
     This option allows you to move the cursor across the battle
     map to place the terrain features. Move the cursor (arrow
     keys) to the desired position then type the letter of the
     feature desired (upper or lower case).
     
              B = Bridge
              C = Clear
              F = Fort
              H = Hill
              M = Mountain
              O = Objective (must have one)
              P = Plowed Field
              R = Road

				- 3  -
 
              S = Swamp
              T = Trees
              V = Village
              W = Water (armies cannot move on water)
     
     You will see a raised "button" on the right hand side of the
     screen. If you press 'D' (for 'Duplicate') while a given
     feature is under the cursor, the button will be depressed,
     meaning the selected feature will be duplicated wherever the
     cursor is moved. Pressing 'D' again will toggle the
     'Duplicate' feature off. This 'Duplicate' mode allows you to
     quickly draw large repetitive map features.
     
     Placing a terrain feature over an army unit causes the army
     to temporarily not be visible. Press 'A' to make armies
     visible again. Use the F10 key to return to the initial menu
     when you have finished editing your map.
     
     If you wish to temporarily remove the armies to view the
     underlying terrain, then press "Z". Pressing "Z" again will
     replace the armies.
     
      3.2  'O' Objective
     ===================
     The scenario will not work properly unless it has an
     objective located on the map. You may also specify an
     alternate objective (see below).
     
     After placing the objective you have the option of having
     the game begin with the objective under control of one of
     the sides instead of having it automatically being
     uncontrolled. A menu will appear when you place the
     objective, which allows you to specify who initially
     controls the objective.
     
     Selecting "None" or pressing "Esc" will cause the objective
     to be uncontrolled. Choosing a side will cause the objective
     to INITIALLY be controlled by that side, whether or not
     there is a unit on the objective. It is presumed to have
     been seized prior to the scenario beginning.
     
      3.3  'L' Alternate Objective
     =============================
     It is now possible to establish a SINGLE alternate
     objective, which becomes the battle objective after a
     specified number of turns into the game. This is done using
     the CIVILSET editor (the "L" command in the Map editor). The
     alternate objective does not appear on the map until the
     specified number of turns has elapsed, when the original
     objective will disappear and be replaced by a specified
     terrain feature.
     
     In the .CIV data file, this will appear on line 26 as a
     series of characters separated by slashes. For instance:
     
     "10/25/17/["

				- 4  -
 
     
     The number before the first slash is the number of turns
     before the alternate objective becomes the active objective
     (10 in the example above).
     
     The next number is the x-coordinate of the alternate
     objective (25 in the example).
     
     The next number is the y-coordinate of the alternate
     objective (17 in the example).
     
     The character after the last slash is the terrain character
     ([ is the 'Bridge' terrain character in the example)
     
      3.4  Removing Alternative Objective
     ====================================
     An alternate objective can be removed only by using the
     'L' command to bring up the alternate objective menu, then
     selecting the Remove option.

      4.1  ARMY Edit
     ===============
     In the army editor You may add new units, edit existing
     units, or remove existing units. At any time, you may REDRAW
     the screen by pressing F3.
     
     You will see at the right of the screen two buttons, a "U"
     (for Union) and an "R" (for Rebel). One button will be
     depressed, the other raised. The depressed button is for the
     side currently being placed. Pressing the other button
     toggles to the other side.
     
     You will also see a window with the letters of the available
     'hot keys'. This will read 'I A E H N C G B' if the cursor
     is not over an army unit. It will read 'D E L M P S T Z' if
     the cursor is over an army unit. For instance, if the cursor
     is not over an existing unit, pressing 'C' will place a
     cavalry unit at the position of the cursor. The complete
     list of editor 'hot keys' show below can be accessed by the
     help menu (F1 key). Also, a status line is provided to show
     unit information by passing the cursor over a unit.
     
      4.2  Add New Unit (Using Hot Keys)
     ===================================
     A unit placed will be for the side currently selected. If
     you use a hot key, the unit type selected is immediately
     placed at the cursor position.
     
        +===================================================+
        | A      rifled ARTILLERY unit at cursor            |
        | B      gun BOAT unit at cursor (must be water hex)|
        | C      CAVALRY unit at cursor                     |
        | E      EMPLACED GUN at cursor                     |

        | I      INFANTRY unit at cursor                    |
        | N      NAPOLEON (smooth bore) artillery at cursor |
        | R      toggle to place Rebel armies               |
        | U      toggle to place Union armies               |
        | F3     redraw the screen                          |
        | F10    return to Main Menu                        |
        +===================================================+
     
      4.3  Add New Unit (Using Menu)
     ===============================
     Alternatively, you may press' Enter' to pop up an menu that
     will allow you to select the unit type to place at the
     cursor position.
     
     You will be prompted to enter the name of the unit. If you
     hit 'Enter' a menu will appear listing the names and
     abilities of 15 prominent leaders for the side being placed.
     If select one of these leaders, the name and associated
     morale/leadership values is automatically assigned to the
     unit. If you press 'Esc' you are returned to the option of
     providing your own name. If you assign your own name, the
     morale/leadership values will initially be set at default
     values.
     
     After you enter the desired name, press 'Enter' and the unit
     will be placed. If you wish to modify any of the unit
     attributes, you must edit the unit as described below.
     
     Each side has a maximum of 40 units available for
     positioning. There is no restriction on number of units of a
     given type. The current number of units of each type and
     total strength of all units is shown for each side as units
     are placed or edited. Also, the ratio of total Union
     strength to total Rebel strength is shown.
     
     The menu also provides a screen redraw feature.
     
      4.4  Edit Existing Unit (Hot Key)
     ==================================
     To edit a unit using the hot keys, place the cursor over the
     unit and press the appropriate key:
     
         +======================================================+
         |  D          DELAY unit                               |

         |  M          modify unit's MORALE factor              |
         |  P          move unit to a new POSITION              |
         |  +          (in conjunction with moving to a new     |
         |             position-- allows units to be stacked)   |
         |  S          modify unit's STRENGTH                   |
         |  T          change a unit's TYPE (I A E H N C G B)   |
         |  Z          ZAP unit at cursor                       |
         |  !          UNzap last unit zapped                   |

     Unit name may be changed by typing in a new name at the
     prompt. You cannot change the unit's side; if unit placed is
     for wrong side, first delete it, then toggle to the other
     side, and place the new unit.
     
     Pressing the 'escape' key will cancel the edit and close the
     edit menu.
     
     
      4.6  Delay Unit (Hot Key = D)
     ==============================
     When specifying a 'Delay' for units, you are given the
     option to have the delayed unit either a) be off the screen
     until the specified delay has elapsed (default option) or b)
     be on screen but simply inactive. When examining a unit, a
     '*'next to the 'Dly' value indicates the unit will be OFF
     SCREEN until the delay elapses. Units that are OFF SCREEN
     will be shown by a blank colored box instead of the normal
     icon.
     
     For example:
       *Dly : 5  means that the unit under the cursor will not
                 appear until 5 turns have elapsed. After that
                 time, the unit will arrive at the battle as soon
                 as the location at the cursor is not occupied by
                 another army.
     
        Dly : 15 means the unit under the cursor will be on the
                 map but inactive until 15 turns elapse.
     
      4.7  Entrench Unit (Hot Key = E)
     =================================
     Units can be 'entrenched' using the editor.
     Computer-controlled units that are entrenched at the
     beginning of a scenario will hold their position during the
     game. Human-controlled units that are entrenched at the

				- 8  -
 
     beginning of a scenario may refuse to leave entrenchments
     (if leadership/morale is low). Even if units follow orders
     to leave entrenchments, they require extra time to do so.
     Once units are un-entrenched, they cannot be re-entrenched
     in the game (though you COULD save the game and re-entrench
     using the editor). While entrenched, units will fight at a
     bonus (in addition to any terrain bonus) if attacked.
     Entrenched artillery units will still fire, but are receive
     the entrenchment defensive bonus.
     
      4.8  Modify Unit Leadership (Hot Key = L)
     ==========================================
     Use up/down arrow keys to change leadership in range of
     10-110. Higher numbers reflect better leadership.
     
      4.9  Modify Unit Morale (Hot Key = M)
     ======================================
     Use up/down arrow keys to change morale in range of 10-110.
     Higher numbers reflect better morale.
     
      4.10 Move Unit to New Position (Hot Key = P)
     =============================================
     Existing units can be repositioned by pressing 'P' when the
     cursor is over the desired unit. The move the cursor to the
     new location, and press 'Enter' to move the unit. This
     feature is not available in the Edit menu.
     
      4.11 Set Stack Flag (Hot Key = +)
     ==================================
     Normally in placing or repositioning units, you cannot stack
     them. However, there is a way to stack units while
     repositioning them (using the "P" command). Press the "+"
     key while the unit is being repositioned to set the Stack
     Flag ON. Then move the unit to the position desired (even if
     on top of another unit) and press Enter. Only one unit will
     be displayed, although more than one unit can occupy the
     same location. This is intended only for delayed units where
     multiple units will come onto the screen at different times
     from the same location. If used otherwise, it could possibly
     lead to strange results during game play.
     
      4.12 Modify Unit Strength (Hot Key = S)
     ========================================
     Use up/down arrow keys to change the unit' strength. Maximum
     strength for artillery units is 1000; for other units it is
     3000.
     
      4.13 Zap Unit (Hot Key = Z)
     ============================
     Using the hot key 'Z' or selecting the 'ZAP UNIT' option
     from the edit window will remove the unit. This is useful to
     remove incorrect units.
     
      4.14 UNZap Unit (Hot Key = !)
     ==============================
     If you accidentally Zapped a unit and HAVE NOT YET PLACED A

				- 9  -
 
     NEW UNIT, an exclamation mark ('!') will appear in the
     window of available options. Pressing '!' will restore the
     unit Zapped at the cursor. (The unit recalled is the LAST
     unit Zapped). If the exclamation mark does not show in the
     window, you cannot recover the Zapped unit.
     
      4.15 Change Unit Type (Hot Key = T)
     ====================================
     When the cursor is over a unit, you may change the unit type
     by first pressing 'T', then responding to the prompt to
     enter the first letter of the unit type. All the other unit
     attributes will remain the same, except that artillery type
     units will be restricted to a maximum strength of 1000.

      5.1  Description
     =================
     The scenario description includes the battle name text that
     appears at the top of the game screen, and the time limit
     (number of turns) for the scenario. NOTE: the battle name
     text description is simply a title line, and NOT the file
     name). DO NOT USE COMMAS. A suggestion is to use the battle
     name and historical date.
     
     You must also select a time limit (number of turns) for the
     scenario. This sets a limit on how long the scenario will
     last.
     
      5.2  Briefing
     ==============
     The scenario briefing consists of up to 22 lines of text
     which is available on-line when the game itself is played.
     You will be prompted for then scenario briefing, which
     should give a synopsis of the battle along with any
     particular battle problems or peculiarities you might want
     to call to attention. When you have finished, pressing the
     'Esc' key will return you to the main menu.
     
      5.3  [convert old format]
     ==========================
     Use this option to read OLD FORMAT files created with early
     versions of CIVILWAR BATTLE SET (prior to version 1.4). Then
     SAVE file as described above. The following procedure is
     suggested:
     
        a) Make a back up copy of your old scenario (just in
           case...)
        b) Load the old scenario using the 'convert old format'
           option.
           (Do NOT use the 'Load Scenario' option or an error
           will result).
        c) Save the scenario under the 'Save Scenario' option. It
           can now be loaded using the 'Load Scenario' option.

      5.4  Directory
     ===============
     With this option you may change the directory or drive used
     by the program for loading and saving files. Simply type the
     new path over the old one that is displayed in the colored
     box, then press "Enter". If the new directory is valid, it
     will be displayed when the main menu returns. Otherwise an
     error message is displayed, and the old directory is
     retained.
     
      5.5  Random Scenario
     =====================
     This option allows you to quickly generate random scenarios.
     In doing this, you will be asked for the battle size
     (ranging from a minor skirmish involving only a few units to
     very large 'epic' battle with the maximum number of units).
     You can also control the balance of the battle, from a
     strong Union advantage (++ Union) to a strong Rebel
     advantage (++ Rebel). The program will automatically create
     the map, place the armies and the objective. The battle will
     also be given a fictitious place name and date. If you like
     how the battle looks, return to the Main Menu to save it
     (the default name will be 'RANDOM.CIV'. Of course, you may
     edit the map or army to modify the random scenario to suit
     your taste.
     
      5.6  CIVILWAR 2.3 Game
     =======================
     Switches to the CIVILWAR BATTLE SET game without exiting to
     DOS.
     
      5.7  Quit
     ==========
     Allows you to exit the program. Be sure you have saved all your
     work first.
